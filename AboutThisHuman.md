- 👋 Hai, I’m @auracles!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things, if I have to specify: humane technology, data privacy(...), traveling, martial arts, debates/conversation, research
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and how human's behaviour can be modified through the screens we're looking at
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate on anything you think you can use my help with (especially happy about any project that has human's wellbeing in mind)
- 📫 You can reach out to me via Reddit (auracles) or via Github if we're having a chat feature here (figuring that one out).

Stay safe and healthy! And in case we get the opportunity to have a conversation, feel free to disagree with me because that is how I learn and we both remeber:)
(the emojis will be changed)
